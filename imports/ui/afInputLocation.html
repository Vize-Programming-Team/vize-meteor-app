	<!-- This is my experimental "hacked" solution for
 		AutoForm's afObjectField not seeming to behave
		properly. It renders the LocationSchema fields
		as opaque "object" things even though I supplied
		their types in the schema. So I'm going to force
		Meteor to do things my way. Nyeh heh heh. -->
	<!-- I figure out that the div wrappers, terminating
 		"help block", id attribute, and other things are
		supplied by the parent AutoForm, so custom input
		types "only have to worry about themselves", which
	 	is nice (for a change). Although I think you still
		have to include {{this.atts}} to pass in the other
		attributes, but that's not too bad. -->
